# NYC Traffic Safety Analysis

NYC Traffic Accidents
Motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department from January 2021 to April 2023. Each record represents an individual collision, including the date, time, and location of the accident (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude), vehicles and victims involved, and contributing factors.

## Project Overview ##

The Project involves analyzing collision data to:
- understand when and where collision occur most frequently.
- Identify Major Contributing Factors
- Suggest actionable strategies to reduce accident rates.

## Tools Used ##
-Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts , Power Query)

-From 2021 to April 9th 2023 , there were total of 2,38,421 motor vehicle collisions reported in New York City.Of these, approximately 36%(87,562 accidents) were classified as dangerous.

Pedestrian fatalities represent 45.46% of all deaths resulting from motor vehicle collisions, highlighting a critical vulnerability for pedestrians in New York City.
Motorists account for 47.51% of fatalities and bear the highest proportion of injuries, comprising 74.16% of all injury cases. This higher fatality rate among motorists is largely attributed to the increased number of vehicles on the road, which raises the likelihood of accidents compared to other road users.

If we look total number of persons Injured and Killed from 2021 to 2023:
