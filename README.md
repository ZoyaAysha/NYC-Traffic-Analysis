# NYC Traffic Safety Analysis

NYC Traffic Accidents
Motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department from January 2021 to April 2023. Each record represents an individual collision, including the date, time, and location of the accident (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude), vehicles and victims involved, and contributing factors.

## Project Overview ##

The Project involves analyzing collision data to:
- understand when and where collision occur most frequently.
- Identify Major Contributing Factors
- Suggest actionable strategies to reduce accident rates.

## Tools Used ##
-Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts , Power Query)

-From 2021 to April 9th 2023 , there were total of 2,38,421 motor vehicle collisions reported in New York City.Of these, approximately 36%(87,562 accidents) were classified as dangerous. This highlights a critical need for immediate action and the implementation of effective measures to improve road safety and reduce the number of serious collisions.

**Injuries and Fatalities:**

Pedestrian fatalities represent 45.46% of all deaths resulting from motor vehicle collisions, highlighting a critical vulnerability for pedestrians in New York City.
Motorists account for 47.51% of fatalities and bear the highest proportion of injuries, comprising 74.16% of all injury cases. This higher fatality rate among motorists is largely attributed to the increased number of vehicles on the road, which raises the likelihood of accidents compared to other road users.

If we look total number of persons Injured and Killed from 2021 to 2023: 

**Seasonality:**

The collision trends New York city shows a clear seasonal pattern , with number of collisions typically rising between April and October before declining towards the end of the year. This pattern is consistent across 2021 and 2022. However, a postive trend can be observed - the overall number of collisions has been decreasing year-over-year. Starting May 2022, collisions counts remained lower compared to 2021, and the early month of 2023 continue this downward trend. This suggests that either enhanced safety measures, changes in traffic patterns, or public awareness efforts might be contributing to the gradual improvement in road safety across the city.

**Most Accidents Reported:**

When analyzing the locations with highest number of reported motor vehicle collisions, Belt Parkway stands out with the greatest number of incidents, recording nearly 3,728 collisions, of which 1,563 were dangerous. Broadway follows closely, with 2,794 collisons reported. Other major hotspots iclude the Atlantic Avenue, Long Island Expressway, and the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, each witnessing a considerable number of accidents.These findings highlight that both expressways and major arterial roads are critical areas for traffic safety improvements, and targeted measures such as stricter speed regulations, better signage, and enhanced monitoring could help reduce collision rates in these zones

**Contributing Factors:**

The analysis of contribting factors reveals that Driver Inattention/Distraction is the leading cause of collisions, responsible for over 58,000 accidents with the dangerous rate of 38.90%. Unspecified cause follow closely, suggesting a need for more detailed reporting to better understand collison causes. Although Failure to yield right-of-way accounts for fewer collisions, it stands out with the highest danger percentage of 63.68%, making one of the most hazardous behaviours on the road. Traffic control disregarded incidents show a high danger rate of 58.64%, emphasizing the serious risk of ignoring traffic signals and signs. Unsafe speed also contributes significantly to severe outcomes with a dangerous percentage of 45.68%, despite fewer total incidents. Overall 35.95% all reported collisions were classified as dangerous, underling the urgent need for focused interventions on these key behaviours.

**Collisions by Hour and Weekday**

The data clearly shows that collisions in New York City are highly time-dependent, following distinct patterns across weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, collision counts peak during rush hours, especially between 8 AM and 6 PM, with the highest concentrations observed around 4 PM and 5 PM — aligning with the evening rush hour when traffic density is at its maximum. Fridays in particular see a slight spike during late afternoon hours, likely due to weekend traffic starting early. On weekends, however, the trend shifts, with midnight (12 AM) witnessing the highest number of collisions, reflecting increased late-night activities. These patterns emphasize the need for targeted interventions during high-risk hours, including increased traffic enforcement and public safety campaigns during both rush hours and late-night periods.

**Recommendations**

To improve road safety in New York City, it is crucial to focus on strengthening road safety initiatives, particularly on major accident-prone roads such as Belt Parkway and Broadway, by enhancing road design, signage, and enforcement. Managing traffic more efficiently during peak rush hours, especially between 8–10 AM and 3–6 PM, can help reduce the high volume of collisions observed during these times. Addressing key contributing factors like driver distraction, failure to yield, and traffic control violations through targeted public awareness campaigns and stricter enforcement can significantly lower collision rates. Given the high proportion of pedestrian fatalities, prioritizing pedestrian-focused interventions such as improved crosswalks, better street lighting, and traffic calming measures is essential. Additionally, implementing nighttime safety programs, particularly on weekends when midnight collisions are high, will help protect all road users. Continuous monitoring of collision trends will enable data-driven decisions and proactive policy adjustments. Finally, although there has been a steady decrease in collisions year-over-year, sustained and adaptive efforts are necessary to maintain and accelerate this positive trend.
